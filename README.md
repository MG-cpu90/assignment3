# Assignment #3: JavaScript, Password Generator

## Summary

Using JavaScript, I created a random password generator. For this assignment, I used: 

* Prompts that allow users to determine their preferred password length (on the condition that it is between 8 and 128 characters)

* Confirms that determine what types of characters they would like to use (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters).

* A function that would generate a password based on the information returned from these prompts and confirms.

* An "addEventListener" feature to the "Generate Password" button, so that the aforementioned prompts, confirms, and function would be initiated once the button was clicked.

## Bugs

The only issue I had was that I was unable to have the password generator clear the previous password from the text box once the "Generate Password" button was pressed a second time.
